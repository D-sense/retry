## About The Project

Package retry is a simple module for retrying a function on a defined interval
until the function succeeds or timeouts. There is support for retrying a
group of functions at different concurrency levels.

All of the documentation can be found on the [go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/massahud/retry?tab=doc) website.
